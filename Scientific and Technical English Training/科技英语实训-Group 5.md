Hello, everyone! My name is Hu Shan.

Today I will focus on the topic of "Abstract Writing" and talk about the writing requirements, basic structure, writing skills and case analysis of the abstract.

First of all, the abstract is the condensed essence of the paper. It helps readers quickly understand the purpose, methods, results and conclusions of the research, so it must be concise. Usually, the word count of the abstract is about 150 to 250 words. Avoid using uncommon words and complex sentences to ensure that readers can quickly understand. For scientific papers, the abstract should avoid using subjective expressions, but describe the research content in the third person and objective language.

Structurally, the abstract of a scientific paper usually contains four parts:
background and purpose: briefly explain the background of the research and why the research was conducted.
Research methods: summarize the main methods or experimental designs used without going into details.
Research results: summarize the main findings or results of the research, supported by quantitative or qualitative data.
Research conclusions: summarize the contribution, significance or application prospects of the research.

Precise and concise language: Avoid lengthy sentences and directly express the core content of the research.
Avoid using abbreviations: Unless the abbreviations are well-known, such as DNA, AI, etc., try to avoid using them.
Use of tenses: Generally, the background section uses past tense or present perfect tense, the method section uses past tense, the results section uses past tense, and the conclusion section can use present tense.
Avoid including citations and data: Literature citations and detailed data should not usually be included in the abstract unless they are the core part of the research.

Next, we will analyze these requirements and techniques in detail through an example. The following is an abstract from a computer science paper:
The blue background briefly introduces the background and purpose of the research, as well as the current problems; the red font introduces the specific methods proposed in the article; the yellow font describes the results, and finally the blue font summarizes the experimental results.

The above is my sharing today. Thank you!

## QA
The primary difference between abstract writing for review and research papers lies in the content and purpose of each type, including purpose、content structure and methods。

In summary, while both types of abstracts aim to concisely convey important information, a research paper abstract focuses on summarizing new research, and a review paper abstract aims to synthesize insights from existing research.
